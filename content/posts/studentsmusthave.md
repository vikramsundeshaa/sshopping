- A backpack: A good-quality backpack is a must-have for students, as it will be used to carry textbooks, notebooks, and other supplies. Look for a backpack that is well-constructed, has comfortable straps, and has enough compartments to keep your things organized.

- A planner or calendar: A planner or calendar will help you keep track of assignments, test dates, and other important deadlines.

- Textbooks: Textbooks are essential for students as they are required for most classes. Be sure to buy your textbooks as soon as you can, as prices can rise as the semester goes on.

- Stationery: Basic stationery items such as pencils, pens, notebooks, and highlighters are essential for students.

- Headphones: Headphones are a great investment for students, as they will be used to block out distractions during studying and classes.

- Flash drive: A flash drive is a handy tool for storing assignments, papers, and other important documents.

- A good mattress: A good mattress is essential for good sleep and to avoid back pains.

- Water bottle: A reusable water bottle is a great way to stay hydrated during the day, and it is also eco-friendly.

- A comfortable chair: A comfortable chair is essential for studying and working, as well as for sitting in classes. Invest in a chair that has good back support, and is adjustable.

It's important to remember that every student's needs are different and that you should prioritize what you need based on your own personal circumstances.
